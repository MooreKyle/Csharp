Instructions

Create a program for Smalltown Regional Airport Flights that accepts either an integer flight number or string airport code from the options in Figure 8-33.

Pass the userâ€™s entry to one of two overloaded GetFlightInfo() methods, and then display a returned string with all the flight details. For example, if 201 was input, the output would be: Flight #201 AUS Austin Scheduled at: 0710 (note that there should be two spaces between 'Austin' and 'Scheduled').

The method version that accepts an integer looks up the airport code, name, and time of flight; the version that accepts a string description looks up the flight number, airport name, and time.

The methods return a message if the flight is not found. For example, if 100 was input, the output should be Flight #100 was not found.

If no flights were scheduled for the airport code entered, for example MCO, the message displayed should be Flight to MCO was not found.
