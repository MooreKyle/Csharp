Instructions

Create a program named Reverse3 whose Main() method declares three integers named firstInt, middleInt, and lastInt.

Assign the following values to the integers:

23 to firstInt
45 to middleInt
67 to lastInt
Then display the values and pass them to a method named Reverse that accepts them as reference variables, places the first value in the lastInt variable, and places the last value in the firstInt variable.

In the Main() method, display the three variables again, demonstrating that their positions have been reversed.
