Instructions

Create an application named ShapesDemo that creates several objects that descend from an abstract class called GeometricFigure. Each GeometricFigure includes a height, a width, and an area.

Provide get and set accessors for each field except area; the area is computed and is read-only. Include an abstract method called ComputeArea() that computes the area of the GeometricFigure.

Next you will create three additional classes derived from the GeometricFigure class. Name these derived classes: Rectange, Square, and Triangle.





Step 2

Create a Rectangle is a GeometricFigure whose area is determined by multiplying width by height.

Create a Square is a Rectangle in which the width and height are the same. Provide a constructor that accepts both height and width, forcing them to be equal if they are not. Provide a second constructor that accepts just one dimension and uses it for both height and width. The Square class uses the Rectangle’s ComputeArea() method.

Create a Triangle is a GeometricFigure whose area is determined by multiplying the width by half the height.

In the ShapesDemo class, after each object is created, pass it to a method that accepts a GeometricFigure argument in which the figure’s data is displayed. Change some dimensions of some of the figures, and pass each to the display method again.
