Instructions

Write the program ReadPatientRecords that reads the file Patients.txt and displays each patientâ€™s data on the screen.

An example of the program is shown below:



IdNumber  Name                 Balance

p1        Patient1              $20.00
p2        Patient2              $40.00
p3        Patient3             $120.00
p4        Patient4              $20.00
p5        Patient5              $35.00



In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using System.Globalization; at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
