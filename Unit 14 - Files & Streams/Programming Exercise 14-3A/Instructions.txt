Instructions

Write the program WritePatientRecords that allows a doctor’s staff to enter data about patients and saves the data to a file called Patients.txt. The output should be in the following format: p#, PATIENT_NAME, BALANCE. Create a Patient class that contains fields for ID number, name, and current balance owed to the doctor’s office.

Save the contents of your output file as you will use them in the subsequent labs.

An example of the program is shown below:



Enter patient ID number or 999 to quit >> PID24584521
Enter last name >> White
Enter balance >> 200
Enter next patient ID number or 999 to quit >> PID98512456
Enter last name >> Pink
Enter balance >> 450
Enter next patient ID number or 999 to quit >> PID21578345
Enter last name >> Brown
Enter balance >> 1000
Enter next patient ID number or 999 to quit >> PID74315491
Enter last name >> Blue
Enter balance >> 650
Enter next patient ID number or 999 to quit >> 999



And the contents of the Patients.txt file:



PID24584521,White,200
PID98512456,Pink,450
PID21578345,Brown,1000
