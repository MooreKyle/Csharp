Instructions

Create an application named SalesTransactionDemo that declares several SalesTransaction objects and displays their values and their sum.

The SalesTransaction class contains the following fields:

Name - The salesperson's name (as a string)
salesAmount - The sales amount ( as a double)
commission - The commission (as a double)
RATE - A readonly field that stores the commission rate (as a double). Define a getRate() accessor method that returns the RATE
Include three constructors for the class. One constructor accepts values for the name, sales amount, and rate, and when the sales value is set, the constructor computes the commission as sales value times commission rate.

The second constructor accepts a name and sales amount, but sets the commission rate to 0.

The third constructor accepts a name and sets all the other fields to 0.

An overloaded + operatoradds the sales values for two SalesTransaction objects and returns a new SalesTransaction object.



In order to prepend the $ to currency values, the program will need to use the CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo method. In order to do this, include the statement using System.Globalization; at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows:



WriteLine("This is an example: {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
