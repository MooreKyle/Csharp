Instructions

Write the program SubscriptExceptionTest in which you use an array of 10 doubles. Write a try block in which you place a loop that prompts the user for a subscript value and displays the value stored in the corresponding array position or asks the user to quit the program by entering 99. Create a catch block that catches any IndexOutOfRangeException and displays the message:



Index was outside the bounds of the array.
